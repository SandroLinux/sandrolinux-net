  <h2>How to install Homebrew/brew On Mac</h2>
  <p>This tutorial i will tell you how to install Homebrew on mac (I will also refer to it as brew). 
     So start off by installing xcode command line tools by entering <b>xcode-select --install</b> into the terminal and hitting enter. 
     If you have got xcode command line tools already installed it should say 
     <b>xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates</b> and if you haven't, it should install. 
     After that go to brew.sh and copy the command from there under the Install Homebrew heading or copy and paste it from here:
     <b>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"</b>
     After doing that Brew should be installed. To check this just type in brew into the terminal and if it does not show an error it should be installed. 
     So brew by defualt only installs command line utilities so you may want to install cask ,a brew app, which lets you install regular GUI apps such as Firefox, Chrome, LBRY, VLC, Chromuium, eta. 
     To install this enter <b>brew install cask</b>. 
     Now you can install GUI apps via the command line by entering <b>brew cask install</b> and then the application you want to install. 
     For example if you wanted to install Firefox you would write <b>brew cask install firefox</b>. 
     Also, with Brew you can easily install updates for your installed applications by entering <b>brew upgrade</b>
     (That will also check for updates for homebrew itself which you can do manually by entering <b>brew update</b>) 
     or <b>brew cask upgrade for casks</b>.</p>
